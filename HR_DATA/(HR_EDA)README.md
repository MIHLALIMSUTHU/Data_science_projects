# Human Resources Workforce & Attrition Analysis (EDA)

## 📊 Project Overview
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Human Resources dataset to understand workforce structure, employee attrition drivers, and compensation fairness. The objective is to extract actionable insights that can support HR decision-making and organizational strategy.

## 🎯 Business Questions
- Which departments and locations experience the highest attrition?
- Are there compensation fairness concerns across gender, education, or job roles?
- Is the workforce exposed to aging or succession risks?
- Which employee segments show elevated retention risk?

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Key Analyses
- Workforce composition by department, gender, and location
- Attrition rate analysis across departments and cities
- Salary and compensation fairness analysis
- Age distribution and succession risk assessment

## 💡 Key Insights
- Attrition is concentrated in specific departments and locations rather than being evenly distributed.
- Salary disparities by gender are present in certain departments, indicating potential pay equity risks.
- While average age is similar across departments, deeper analysis reveals different age structures with varying business implications.
- Mid-tenure employees appear more likely to exit, suggesting career progression challenges.

## 📈 Recommendations
- Implement targeted retention strategies in high-churn departments.
- Conduct formal pay equity audits and standardize compensation bands.
- Introduce succession planning and knowledge transfer initiatives.
- Develop HR dashboards to continuously monitor workforce health.
