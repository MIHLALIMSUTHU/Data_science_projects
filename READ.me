# Google Play Store App Analysis

## Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Google Play Store Apps dataset. The goal is to understand various characteristics of the apps, such as categories, ratings, reviews, and installation trends.

## Dataset
The dataset used is `googleplaystore.csv`, which contains information about apps available on the Google Play Store.

## Analysis Performed
The analysis includes the following steps:

1.  **Data Loading and Initial Inspection**: Loaded the dataset into a pandas DataFrame and displayed the first and last few rows to get a glimpse of the data.
2.  **Dataset Shape**: Determined the number of rows and columns in the dataset.
3.  **Data Information**: Obtained a summary of the DataFrame, including data types and non-null counts for each column.
4.  **Descriptive Statistics**: Generated overall statistics for numerical columns, specifically focusing on app ratings.
5.  **App Name Analysis**: Identified and counted apps containing specific keywords like 'Astrology'.
6.  **Average App Rating**: Calculated the overall average rating of apps.
7.  **Unique Categories**: Determined the total number of unique app categories.
8.  **Highest Average Rated Category**: Found the app category with the highest average rating.
9.  **5-Star Rated Apps**: Counted the total number of apps with a perfect 5-star rating.
10. **Reviews Data Cleaning**: Converted the 'Reviews' column to a numeric data type to enable quantitative analysis.
11. **Reviews Statistics**: Obtained descriptive statistics for the 'Reviews' column.
12. **Free vs. Paid Apps**: Analyzed the distribution of free and paid applications.
13. **Apps with Maximum Reviews**: Identified the app(s) with the highest number of reviews.
14. **Average Rating by Type**: Calculated and displayed the average app ratings for free and paid applications.

## Technologies Used
*   Python
*   Pandas (for data manipulation and analysis)
*   Numpy (for numerical operations)
*   Matplotlib (for data visualization - *though not explicitly used in output, standard for EDA*)
*   Seaborn (for data visualization - *though not explicitly used in output, standard for EDA*)

## How to Run
1.  Ensure you have Python and necessary libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn) installed.
2.  Download the `googleplaystore.csv` dataset.
3.  Run the Jupyter Notebook/Colab notebook cells sequentially.
